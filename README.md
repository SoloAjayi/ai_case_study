## Overview and Origin
The company I chose for this case study is Nike.
Nike was incorporated on January 25th, 1964 in Eugene, Oregon.
Nike was founded by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman.
The idea for Nike began in the 1960s when Phil Knight traveled to Japan and discovered the Onitsuka Tiger brand (now known as Asics). Impressed by the quality of the shoes, Knight saw an opportunity to bring these Japanese athletic shoes to the United States. In 1964, Knight and Bowerman formed Blue Ribbon Sports (which eventually changed into Nike), initially operating as a distributor for Onitsuka Tiger shoes.
Nike is a publicly traded company, primarily generating funding through various sources such as revenue from sales, investors, or borrowing.

## Business Activities
Nike is not focused on solving a specific problem. Instead, it addresses various challenges and opportunities within the athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry. Nike's mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, and these efforts involve addressing a range of challenges and opportunities within the sports industry.
Nike's intended customers are athletes, fitness enthusiastsm casual wearers, and kids. Since Nike has a vast and diverse target base spanning across different regions, demographics, and consumer segments it is difficult tp provide an accurate market size.
Nike has several competitive advantages that differentiate it from its competitors such as innovative product development, strong brand image and marketing, an extensive distribution network, their commitment to sustainability, digital and technological advancements, and their focus on inclusivity and diversity.
Nike is currently using AI technology to enhance customer experience through hyper-accurate shoe fitting, personalized offers, and virtual assistants.

## Landscape 
Nike is in the daily life field, more specifically in the in the footwear and apparel industry.
The biggest trends and innovations in this industry include the boom of athletic wear being worn as fashion birthing the term, Athleisure. Also, the digital transformantion has revolutionized how shoes are bought. 
Nike's biggest competitors in this industry include: Sketchers, Adidas, New Balance, Asics, and Steve Madden.

## Results
Nike is the leader of their industry they currently sell their products in 170 countries, employ more than 30,000 employees, has a dozen brands that serve more than 30 major sports and consumer lifestyles, work with over 600 factory partners, and serve millions of consumers with thousands of products.
The major core metrics used in this industry are revenue, sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, net income, and market share. Nike is the leader of the industry in almost all of these metrics.
Nike is the leader of the industry, currently setting the pace and pushing innovative technology and campaigns.

## Recommendations
A product I would advise Nike to implement is a virtual shoe sizer on their app that allows customers to virtually figure out what size they are in a specific shoe before they purchase.
I believe that this product would benefit the customers because not all nike shoes fit the same way which can cause customers to be unhappy and also have foot pain. So with this virtual sizer customers can ensure they get the correct fitting shoe size.
This product would be AI based utilizing the customers camera on their smartphone.
The technology needed is appropriate because once Nike develops the AI code it will be accesible through their already established app. Then the customer will just need to use their smartphone's camera to access it.
